"Kubernetes cone"

_K8st端te is a playful take on the traditional German Schult端te ("school cone") which is typically filled with candies, chocolates, and school supplies to make the first day of school a little sweeter for children. In this case, K8st端te is a Kubernetes learning repository that is also filled with various sweet and random things, like config files and documentation, to help those who are just starting out with Kubernetes feel a little less anxious and have some fun while learning._
